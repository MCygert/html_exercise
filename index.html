            Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson steps outside his
            contemporary world of dysfunctional Angelenos to explore a very
            different dysfunctional man -- an oil pioneer whose trailblazing
            spirit is equaled only by his murderous ambition. There Will Be
            Blood is Anderson's loose adaptation of the novel Oil! by Upton
            Sinclair, and it focuses its attentions on Daniel Plainview
            (Daniel Day-Lewis), a miner who happens upon black gold during a
            disastrous excavation that ends in a broken leg.

            Christian is the respected curator of a contemporary art museum, a
            divorced but devoted father of two who drives an electric car and
            supports good causes. His next show is "The Square", an
            installation which invites passersby to altruism, reminding them
            of their role as responsible fellow human beings.

            Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, an allegorical
            science fiction film like his earlier Solaris, was adapted from
            the novel Picnic by the Roadside by brothers Boris Strugatsky and
            Arkady Strugatsky. The film follows three men -- the Scientist
            (Nikolai Grinko), the Writer (Anatoliy Solonitsyn), and the
            Stalker (Alexander Kaidanovsky) -- as they travel through a
            mysterious and forbidden territory in the Russian wilderness
            called the "Zone."

            From Robert Eggers, the visionary filmmaker behind modern horror
            masterpiece The Witch, comes this hypnotic and hallucinatory tale
            of two lighthouse keepers on a remote and mysterious New England
            island in the 1890s.

            The story of Diao Yinan's new film, The Wild Goose Lake, is
            simple, almost allegorical: a man of the underworld is thrust onto
            a perilous journey to death to redeem himself. Zhou Zenong (Hu Ge)
            leads a gang that specializes in stealing motorbikes in the
            streets of Wuhan
