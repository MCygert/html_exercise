    Andrei Tarkovsky is one of those names that strikes a certain intimidating foreboding in even the heartiest, most
    adventuresome of moviegoers, a filmmaker who is arguably more respected than deeply known. The rereleases of two of
    his films, 1979’s “Stalker” and 1972’s “Solaris,” may help change that.
  </p>
  <p>
    The films’ screenings this week at the Nuart — “Stalker” plays Friday to Monday, “Solaris” Tuesday to Thursday —
    provide a great opportunity to consider them anew. It’s also a pleasant happenstance that they are hitting local
    screens at the same time that “Alien: Covenant” is opening. The recent turn toward deeper, metaphysical
    considerations in that venerable franchise only makes Tarkovsky’s heady, poetic takes on science-fiction seem that
    much more fully realized.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Solaris” has up to now been the better-known of the two, in part for its more easily graspable lost-in-space story
    line and also for Steven Soderbergh’s 2002 remake. Which makes “Stalker” the real revelation of the pair. “Stalker”
    recently broke box office records when it played at the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City and,
    incredibly, had the second-highest per-screen average nationwide behind only the opening of “Guardians of the Galaxy
    Vol. 2.” (A very different kind of science fiction film.)
