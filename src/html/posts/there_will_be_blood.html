  <p>
    This is a film by Paul Thomas Anderson that has overshot the runway of movie modernity with something thrillingly,
    dangerously new.
  </p>
  <p>
    That title is subtler than you think. Blood only makes its appearance in the very last, operatic scene. Before that,
    the wounds are internal, or covered by another liquid, gushing from the ground as from a slashed artery. The leading
    character is often to be seen darkly smothered in it, like a voodoo priest after a spectacular sacrifice. It is oil:
    the dwindling lifeblood of our 21st-century prosperity.
    </p2>
  <p>
    With its lowering, psychotic atmosphere and its Bunyanesque surnames, There Will Be Blood is so potent and so
    strange that it almost seems to have been delivered here from another planet. I can only describe it as an epic
    portrait, running from the beginning of the 20th century to the great crash of 1929. The movie speaks of oil's
    savage, entrepreneurial pre-history; in one haunted man, it shows our dysfunctional relationship with capital and
    natural resources, and even hints at a grim future in which our addiction to oil can no longer be fed. Daniel
    Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, a pioneer silver-miner who chances upon oil in 1898, a discovery he greets with a
    brief, leonine grin - one of the very few times he smiles. Shrewdly, ruthlessly, Plainview parlays that initial
    stroke of good luck into a gigantic fortune, driven by pride and misanthropic contempt for everyone and everything
    around him. But Plainview has one vulnerability: he has an adopted son, named HW (Dillon Freasier), whom he loves
    and yet exploits. And he has an enemy: a smooth and sanctimonious young preacher, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), whose
    family ranch Plainview has had to buy to get at the oceans of oil underground.
